# Anomaly Detection Project

### Author: Austin Aranda

## Description: 

The purpose of this project is to research and discover any anomalies regarding access to the Codeup curriculum. Then provide results via email along with deliverables that will summarize the findings and discoveries. 

Deliverables:

    1. 1 side that summarizes all key findings.
    
    2. Acquire.py, and Prep.py files to be able to recreate my efforts.
    
    3. Email with the results of my research.

## Project Planning

Initial Questions:

- How long after graduation were students still accessing the curriculum?
- Are there any cohorts that accessed the curriculum more than others?
- How many people who are unaffiliated with Codeup are accessing the curriculum?



## Key Findings

- Web Dev Students access the Javascript I portion of the curriculum the most.
Data Science students access Intro to Data science the most.
- Zoom appears to have had a major impact on the activity to the curriculum from past cohorts, since the instructors have the ability to screen share the curriculum.
- Voyageurs graduated 2 years ago and has the most curriculum activity after graduation than any other cohort, which was somewhat odd because the activity has been as recent as last month.
- The rest of the IP's appear to just be outliers and we can ignore the noise that is most likely resulting from multiple IP use.


## Takeaways

- This data presented some opportunities to possibly review any gaps in potential curriculum theft.
- There are several points where students are accessing the curriculum many years after they have left Codeup.
- There are also many accesses from untracked ip's and we have no idea if it's an actual student or admin.
- It also appears that there are some lessons that are overlapped by instructor tutorials so the students aren't referring directly to the curriculum for any further development.
- The crossover between access to both programs appears to have still kept going, but we would need further review to see if the Bayes student became an instructor or staff member and is just accessing both as part of the benefit of being an employee.
- Overall, this data is very useful for anomaly detection and discovery to see if there are any trends going on in each cohort.
