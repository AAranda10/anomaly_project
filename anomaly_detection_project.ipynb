    "- Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students? \n",
    "- Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldn’t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses? Any odd user-agents? \n",
    "- At some point in the last year, ability for students and alumni to cross-access curriculum (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before? \n",
    "- What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)? \n",
    "- Which lessons are least accessed? \n",

    "- There are also many accesses from untracked ip's and we have no idea if it's an actual student or admin.\n",
    "- It also appears that there are some lessons that are overlapped by instructor tutorials so the students aren't referring directly to the curriculum for any further development.\n",
